# Child-Mortality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning project to predict child mortality using demographic and health data.
# Child Mortality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of child mortality (under 5 years old) based on **health and demographic data**. It helps identify children who may be at higher risk so that preventive actions can be taken.

## What’s in the project
- Data includes child’s age, gender, birth order, mother’s age, birth weight, vaccination status, and health conditions.
- Data is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
- Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Purpose
The goal is to provide a **simple, data-driven tool** to support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk children.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
